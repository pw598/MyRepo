    "##### This dataset was obtained by bouncing sonar off of rock and metal cylinders (mines), with the objective of being able to use the sonar to accurately determine which items are which. The dataset has 60 features (sensors), so perhaps algorithms which inherently select for features will perform best. I will try some traditional classification algorithms along with feature selection as well."
